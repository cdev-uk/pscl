# PSCL: Paul's Simple C Library

A simple C library containing functions to assist with common tasks such as
manipulating strings, beyond what is available in the standard library.

The only dependencies are:

* Compiler supporting C89
* Copy of the C standard library
* Unity test framework (included as a submodule)
* Make (to build and run the tests)

Any POSIX-compliant Make software *should* work - if not please raise an
issue as this is considered a bug.
